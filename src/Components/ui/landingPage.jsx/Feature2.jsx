              The Osun-Osogbo Festival is an annual celebration in Osogbo,
              Nigeria, to honor Osun, the Yoruba goddess of fertility and water.
              The festival lasts two weeks and includes traditional cleansing,
              lighting of the 500-year-old sixteen-point lamp called “Iná
              Olójúmẹ́ríndínlógún” (16 face lamp). The Festival culminates in a
              procession to the shrine in the sacred Osun-Osogbo grove where a
              large crowd builds up. This event is led by the sitting “Atáòjà”
              of Osogbo along with a ritualized performer called the “Arugbá”
              (calabash carrier) and a committee of priestesses.

              The Ojude Oba Festival is a vibrant and colorful cultural
              celebration held annually in Ijebu-Ode, a historic town in Ogun
              State, Nigeria. The festival, which translates to "The King's

              heritage and traditions of the Ijebu people, one of the prominent
              subgroups of the Yoruba ethnic group. During the festival,
              thousands of people from Ijebu-Ode and surrounding communities
              gather at the palace of the Awujale of Ijebuland, the paramount
              ruler of the Ijebu kingdom, to pay homage to the king and
              celebrate the town's cultural heritage. One of the highlights of
              the Ojude Oba Festival is the procession of the various age
              groups, each accompanied by drummers, dancers, and praise singers.
              The different groups showcase their unique cultural performances,
              including traditional music, dance routines, and acrobatic
              displays, adding to the festive atmosphere.
